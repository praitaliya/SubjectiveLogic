# SubjectiveLogic'
In this project we have demonstrated the implementation of a simple decision support system that allows us to generate the opinions about likelihood of particular disease. The parameters of subjective logic are calculated on the basis of EMS dataset and the opinion is generated which is further used on various concepts like subjective logic operators and complex subjective logic expressions. Our architecture allows users to interact with the system in order to provide input for getting the particular opinion. The concept of subjective logic allows to deal with uncertainty thereby providing the accurate predictions based on the data given.

Currently the framework presents calculations of binomial opinion with their beta representation foregoing recent work on multinomial opinions. We have also limited our scope to few operators in order to provide a better understanding of presented work and to reduce the complexity of the application created.

If anyone is looking forward to work in Subjective Logic, i would appreciate any contribution to this repo.
